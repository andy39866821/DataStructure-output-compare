2 commands:

1. make runk
	for k-core output compare,
	YOU SHOULD NAMED YOUR TXT AS kcore_cmp.txt

2. make runc
	for clique output compare,
	YOU SHOULD NAMED YOUR TXT AS clique_cmp.txt
  

for example:
$ make runk
$ make runc

then you will get a FILE named compare_result.txt
same meaning CORRECT
difference meaning WRONG
WARNING : IF YOU DID NOT CHANGE FILE NAME , YOU WILL ALWAYS GET "different"


PS.
if you have another input file want to test
just change the 2 output file name as 
1. kcore.txt and kcore_cmp.txt
2. clique.txt ans clique_cmp.txt

hava a nice winter vacation :)
